# surf-school-improvement

Improve the Ecuadorian surf school website: Remove the contact form and only include a WhatsApp contact button. Fix the language switching feature (English/Spanish) and move the language button to the top right of the webpage. Make the language button smaller and more user-friendly. Place social media buttons in the footer. Create fake seeds (data) to enhance the website's appearance.
